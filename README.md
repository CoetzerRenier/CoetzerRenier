- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Renier Coetzer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently in my third and final year of college at Varsity College Durban North, South Africa. Studying Computer and Information Sciences in Application Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently actively working with and learning C#, HTML, CSS and SQL. I really enjoy the process of designing and coding up projects, wether the project is a website, UI for a game or just a simple program!
